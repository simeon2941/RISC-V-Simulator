# RISC-V-Simulator
Execute binary file by loading it into a simulated memory of sufficient size and then decode and execute each
32-bit instruction one-at-a-time starting from address zero and continuing until an an ebreak instruction is
encountered, the instruction-count limit is reached, or an illegal instruction has been encountered.
